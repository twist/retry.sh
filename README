retry.sh
--------

a friend of mine likes to listen to online radio via mplayer. 
but, especialy at noon, the server likes to kick him, which means he has to stop 
doing what he is doing and restart mplayer - this is what retry.sh now does for him.

usage
-----

$ retry.sh PROGRAM_TO_EXECUTE


retry.sh will try it 30 times. 



known issues:
-------------

you cant stop it via ^c. Try ^z and kill the sleeoing process
